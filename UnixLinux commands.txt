touch - A command you can use to quickly create a file that you can also “touch” on existing files (We'll dive into that later)
[roman@linuxbox `]$ touch createfile

You'll notice that “createfile” wasn't there before but when I used it with the “touch” command it was created. Nothing is in createfile but it exists.

touch command will change both the access and modification timestamps if the file is already existing.
if files doesnt exist,then touch command will create an empty file

file1 will be moved from source to destination
